        The <b>cat</b> (<em>Felis catus</em>), commonly referred to as the
        domestic cat or house cat, is the only domesticated species in the
        family Felidae. Recent advances in archaeology and genetics have shown
        that the domestication of the cat occurred in the Near East around 7500
        BC. It is commonly kept as a house pet and farm cat, but also ranges
        freely as a feral cat avoiding human contact. It is valued by humans for
        companionship and its ability to kill vermin. Because of its retractable
        claws it is adapted to killing small prey like mice and rats. It has a
        strong flexible body, quick reflexes, sharp teeth, and its night vision
        and sense of smell are well developed. It is a social species, but a
        solitary hunter and a crepuscular predator. Cat communication includes
        vocalizations like meowing, purring, trilling, hissing, growling, and
        grunting as well as cat body language. It can hear sounds too faint or
        too high in frequency for human ears, such as those made by small
        mammals. It also secretes and perceives pheromones.

        The origin of the English word cat, Old English catt, is thought to be
        the Late Latin word cattus, which was first used at the beginning of the
        6th century<sup
