    <!-- Block and inline 
  
    Block elements have their own block with width padding and height
    so things subsequently get pushed down the page like a p tag

    Inline elements flow inside a block element like a link tag
  -->

    <!-- Generic containers 
  
    Generic block 
    <div> - a division in a document, doesn't have meaning but 
    allows us to put things inside of it to target through css and js.
    It's just a box. A way to group together block level elements

    Generic inline 
    <span> - a way to group together a bunch of inline elements
  -->

    <!-- Content sectioning
    
    Block level elements that have more meaning to target
